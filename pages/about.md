I am a software engineer who enjoys watching football, walking around and great food. Coming from an interdisciplinary background, I have experience in robotics, telecommunication, software engineering and game development. I am a supporter of the Arsenal football club and barely miss their game. I play games, mostly city building, management and simulation games.
